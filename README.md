Cypress for testing your web applications.

> Starting with Cypress for testing your web applications is a great choice! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Basic Knowledge**: It's helpful to have a basic understanding of JavaScript since Cypress tests are written in JavaScript.
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your computer because Cypress is a Node.js application. You can _[download](https://nodejs.org/en)_ it from Node.js official website.

## 2. Installation

- **Create a Project Directory**: If you don’t already have a project set up, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using your command line tool.
- **Install Cypress**: Run the following command in your project directory:<br>
  `npm install cypress --save-dev`
  > This command installs Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.

## 3. Opening Cypress

- **Open Cypress for the First Time**: Run `npx cypress open` in your project directory. This command opens the Cypress Test Runner, and Cypress will create a `cypress` folder and some default configuration files.
- **Explore Example Tests**: Cypress includes several example tests that you can look at to understand how to write your tests.

## 4. Learning, Experiment and Expand
